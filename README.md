# Mini-Project-for-Work-Study
A project for a Work Study course. I worked with 3 members, and I am the fourth. 

In this project, we applied motion study (method study) and time study (work measurement) to the process of assembling sawdust to form a decorative shingle, applied these two terms and then compared the results before and after the procedure. It mainly consists of two parts, study method and time.

We applied the following steps in order to apply the method studyÂ procedures:
(1) Select the work to be studied/analyzed and define objectives to be achieved by method study.
(2) Record all relevant facts
(3) Examine all the recorded data information
(4) Modification and improvements in current data
(5) Measure the work content and establish the standard time
(6) Define new method for the job/process/operation
(7) Install and maintain the new method to achieve. Then We will apply time measurement
